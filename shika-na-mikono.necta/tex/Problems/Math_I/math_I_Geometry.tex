		\item 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)] What is the sum of the interior angles of an octagon?
		\item[(ii)] Find the size of the exterior angle of a regular octagon.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\item Calculate the size of an interior angle of a regular nonagon.
	
	\item A regular polygon has an exterior angle of $36^\circ$. Calculate:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item[(a)] the size of an interior angle
		\item[(b)] the number of sides of the polygon
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item An exterior angle of a regular polygon has degree measure of 22$^1/_2$. Find the sum of degree measure of all the interior angles.
	
	\item The interior angle of a regular polygon is $120^\circ$ greater than the exterior angle. Find the number of sides of the polygon.
	
	\item If the interior angle of a regular polygon is $6^1/_2$ times the exterior angle, how many sides does the polygon have?
