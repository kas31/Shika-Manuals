\subsection{Hardness of Water}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item With the aid of a chemical equation, briefly explain how
	\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0ex,itemsep=0ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
		\item[i)] temporary hardness of water can be removed by boiling
		\item[ii)] permanent hardness of water can be removed by chemical means
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item A student tested four samples of water, each 5 cm$^3$ from different areas of Kahama district by shaking with 3 drops of soap solution. The experiment was repeated by boiling each sample of water (5 cm$^3$) with 3 drops of soap solution. The observations were recorded in below table.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
			\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Sample}} & \multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Observation with Soap Solution}} & \textbf{Observation for Boiled Sample} \\ 
			& & \textbf{with Soap Solution} \\ \hline
			A & No lather & Lather \\ \hline
			B & Lather & Lather \\ \hline
			C & Lather & Lather \\ \hline
			D & No lather & No lather \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0ex,itemsep=0ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
		\item[i)] Which samples contain hard water?
		\item[ii)] Which sample contains temporary hard water? Give a reason.
