\subsection{Ionic Theory and Electrolysis}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item State three industrial applications of electrolysis
	
	\item How long a current of 5A should be passed through a solution of silver chloride in order to deposit 3.24 g of silver metal at the cathode? Given that, the electrochemical equivalent of silver = 1.118 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ ge$^{-1}$. 
	
	\item A steady current of 2A was passed through a solution containing ions of a metal (X$^{2+}$) for nine minutes. The mass of metal X that was liberated were 0.3552 g. Calculate the molar mass of metal X. 
	
\end{enumerate}
